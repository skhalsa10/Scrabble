Computer AI take turn method.
right now it averages 26 seconds
of the 21 length board that has no blanks in the tile tray

---------AFTER making the horizontal method return void---------------------------

No difference I reverted this back.

_--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will rebuild the word before I send it into the recursion this should solve this vertical example

 x _ _ _ _        the word is "p"
 x _ _ t _
 x x x p _
 x _ _ b _
 x x x x x
 x _ _ _ _

we start at p we get we check to see if p is a prefix it returns t and b for places to try the tile
we go down the path of checking the bottom and place 'c' at the b spot

 x _ _ _ _        the word is "pc"
 x _ _ _ _
 x x x p _
 x _ _ c _
 x x x x x
 x _ _ _ _

now we check to see if pc is a prefix. when the real prefix is actually "pcx" if pc is a prefix that we go down another sett of recursion
if pcx is not a prefix we eliminate this potentially expensive recursion path. and all it cost was n+1 where n is the size of the word

This seemed seemed promising but made it way worse!!! it took 113 seconds to run with only the verticle changed shit! maybe I can build on the world while I check
for a bottom point.

checking for the word every time through takes to long I will try a new version of get bottom open that build onto the word

-------------------------------------------------------
at first this made no difference and it was because i realized I was not changing anything to the string if you pass in a string it passes in a copy of it in java

This worked better I shaved it down from 26 seconds to 22 seconds!!  this only build as I look at the bottom
now lets see if I build as I go up the top as the same theory can happen in reverse I actually think it is the only correct problem solver anyways.

_-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lets make the same exact changes to the horizontal word checker:

currently we are at 22 seconds.

!!!!!!!!!!!WE MADE IT DOWN TO 20 SECONDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this is not really dramatically better but still 2 seconds is decent

it could be the layout of the board that make it not as dramatic.
